/*  Implementation steps

    • This is considerably easy to implement, we start by creating a separate class, then the static method that is
      going to return the object of the desired type.
    • Notice also that it usually accepts an argument which is going to be what will decide the object type to be
      returned.
    • It can accept additional arguments as well, that would be used to instantiate the return object.
