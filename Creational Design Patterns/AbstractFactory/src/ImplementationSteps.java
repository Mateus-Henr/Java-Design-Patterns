/*
    Implementation Steps

    • Plan on how to implement the "sets".
    • Create the abstract factory as an abstract class or interface, with methods for creating products.
    • Provide concrete implementation of factory for each set of products.
    • This design pattern makes use of factory method pattern. This is basically an object with multiple factory
      methods.
