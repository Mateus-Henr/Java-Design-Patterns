/*  Pitfalls

    • Be aware that if implemented and used correctly there are no pitfalls.


    What are the pitfalls when dealing with design patterns
    • Number of new classes to be added.
    • Impact to refactor existing code.
    • Complexity to understand.


    Some pitfalls of this pattern
    • Method chaining (if it's a beginner to Java)
    • Partially initialized object - Notice that if required properties are missing the Builder has to provide them or
      throw an exception.
