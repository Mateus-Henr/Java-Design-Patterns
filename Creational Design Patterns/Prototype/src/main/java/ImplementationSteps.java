/*
    Implementation Steps

    • Create the class that will be the prototype.
    • It must implement the Cloneable interface.
    • Overwrite the "clone()" method. Decide if between a shallow copy (copy attributes) or a deep copy (recreate all
      objects).
    • The method should declare CloneNotSupportedException.
