/*
    Implementation Considerations

    • The Creator can be a concrete class if provided a default implementation.
    • The factory method could take arguments to decide upon which object to create.


    Design Consideration
    • The factory design reflects the product hierarchy. So we usually end up with a concrete creator per object type.
    • "Abstract Factory" makes use of Factory method pattern just like some Template method design patterns.
