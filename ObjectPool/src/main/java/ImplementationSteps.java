/*
    Implementation Steps

    • First we create a class for object pool.
    • Then a thread-safe caching of objects should be done in pool.
    • Methods to acquire and release objects should be provided and pool should reset cached objects
      before giving them out.
    • The reusable object must provide methods to reset its state.
    • When implementing it we can either create new pooled objects when pool is empty or to wait until
      an object becomes available. This is based on whether the object is tied to a fixed number of
      external resources.
