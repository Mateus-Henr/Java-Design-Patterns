/*
    Implementation Steps

    • Firstly we create a class for Adapter, and it must implement the interface expected by client.
    • When using a Class Adapter, we extend from our existing class, and we forward the method to another
      method inherited from adaptee.
    • In the case of Object Adapter, we implement the target interface and accept adaptee as constructor
      argument in adapter by using composition.
