/*
    Implementation Steps

    • Define abstraction as needed by client.
        • Determine common base operations and define them.
        • There's also the option of defining a refined abstraction (more specialized operations).
    • Define implementor, its methods do not have to match with abstractor.
        • However abstraction can happen using Implementor methods.
    • Write one or more concrete Implementor providing implementation.
    • Abstractions are created by composing them with an instance of concrete Implementor which is used by methods in
      abstraction.
