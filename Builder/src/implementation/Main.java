package implementation;/*  Builder Implementation


    Implementation steps

    Step 1
    • We start by creating a builder.
    • We identify the "parts" of the product and provide methods to create those parts.
    • It should provide a method to "assemble" or build the product/object.
    • It must provide a way/method to get fully built object out. Optionally builder can keep reference to a product
      it has built so the same can be returned again in the future.

    Step 2
    • A director can be a separate class or client can play the role of director.
