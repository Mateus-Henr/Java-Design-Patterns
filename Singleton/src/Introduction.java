    Introduction

    What is a Singleton?
    • A singleton class has only one instance, accessible globally through a single point (method/field).
    • This ensures that only a single instance of a class exists.
    • Any state modified/added in your singleton becomes the "global state" of your application.


    UML (Role)
    • Singleton - Responsible for creating an unique instance and provides an static method to get the instance.
